 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A way to think about this is that a {@link Coordinate} contains information about both
 * where to look and what to look for. This should retain only information about what is
 * being looked for. So if a {@link dev.mccue.resolve.maven.MavenCoordinate} has information
 * about the version of a library to look for and the repository to search for that library,
 * this should retain only the version.
